 Total Revenue: The dashboard will provide a clear view of the companyâ€™s overall revenue of Rs 35.20,984.00, offering insights into overall sales performance. This will serve as the baseline for understanding the company's financial health.

Average Order and Delivery Time: A crucial metric for customer satisfaction, this section will analyze the average time it takes for orders to be processed and delivered, helping identify bottlenecks and improve delivery timelines.

Monthly Sales Performance: This section will visualize how sales fluctuate month-to-month in 2023, providing insights into seasonal trends, sales peaks, and dips. This can guide promotional strategies and inventory management.

Customer Spending Analysis: The dashboard will provide an analysis of average customer spending of Rs 3520.98, helping identify high-value customers, potential upsell opportunities, and areas for improving customer retention.

   Sales Performance by Top 5 Products: By tracking the sales performance of the top 5 products, this feature will help evaluate which specific products contribute most to sales and how their performance evolves over time.

Top 10 Cities by Number of Orders: This analysis will identify the top 10 cities with the highest volume of orders, enabling targeted marketing, distribution, and localized promotional efforts.

Order Quantity vs. Delivery Time: This feature will explore whether higher order quantities correlate with longer delivery times, helping to optimize logistics and supply chain efficiency.

Revenue Comparison Between Occasions: This analysis will compare the **revenue generated across different occasions(e.g., holidays, promotions, special events) to identify which occasions drive the highest revenue and to inform future event-based sales strategies.

   Product Popularity by Occasion: The dashboard will identify which products are most popular during specific occasions (e.g., Christmas, Black Friday, etc.), enabling targeted inventory planning and marketing efforts around key times of the year.
